# Data_Mining-Project

The data set we chose was “Mushroom dataset” and data mining task associated with it was classification.The problem was to classify a given mushroom sample as either poisonous or edible.

We got our hands dirty with data cleaning tools - Data Wrangler and Open Refine which enabled us to clean messy data efficiently and thus leaving us with more time to analyse the data and draw conclusions and identify patterns from it.The data set contained missing values and other faulty entries which was taken care of using these tools.

After cleaning data, we explored data mining tool WEKA in which we performed numerous classification methods in order to select a classifier which outperformed others and which served our purpose.
